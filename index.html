            Since I graduated from college with accounting major, I have been doing an accounting job for 5 years. After I moved to Austin, I found that a lot of my friends are doing software and there are plenty of job opportunities for web development. 
            I’m considering it’s time to try a new field I never touch before.

            Now, I join the coding bootcamp and give myself a chance to try. It’s challenging and interesting for me so far. 
            It trains my logic ability. During the first month in the program, I have experience with web design tech, 
            such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, etc. I feel comfortable working with others and doing the assignments independently.
        
            In the future, I will always focus on the web development (front-end, back-end and full stack) with passion, and keep learning from work.
